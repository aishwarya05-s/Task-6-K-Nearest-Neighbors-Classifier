1. Dropped the unnecessary column "Id".

2. Correlation matrix:
   i) We observe a high positive correlation between Sepal Length and Petal Length.
   ii) We observe a high positive correlation between Sepal Length and Petal Width.
   iii) We observe a moderate negative correlation between sepal width and petal length.
   iv) We observe a moderate negative correlation between sepal width and petal width.
   v) We observe a high positive correlation between Petal width and Petal Length.

3. We observe an elbow point at k=3; thus, the optimal value of k is 3.

4. The model accuracy is 0.96 indicating good classification.
